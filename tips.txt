dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc) can have undefined
behaviour, check that it does not return NULL

except for char arrays, C does not know when an array ends, one can create a
new type which stores the array and its length (to know when to end loops)

be careful about the type of numbers when doing divisions

include the librairies as arguments when compiling with gcc, otherwise you get
"not defined"

use "%*c" in scanf() to read a character (like pressing key <Enter>) but ignore it

the command "locate myheader.h" will return the path if it exists

find where gcc looks for header files (i.e. where C preprocessor looks for 'includes')
`gcc -print-prog-name=cpp` -v

error: variably modified ‘gSpriteClips’ at file scope
cannot have a static array which size is given as a variable
use #define

cannot have non-constant global variables
