dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc) can have undefined
behaviour, check that it does not return NULL

except for char arrays, C does not know when an array ends, one can create a
new type which stores the array and its length (to know when to end loops)

be careful about the type of numbers when doing divisions

include the librairies as arguments when compiling with gcc
